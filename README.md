# exquilla
Extension for Thunderbird providing email and contact accounts using Exchange Web Services

This is the code for the current release of ExQuilla.

At this point in time, I do not intend to do any more releases. ExQuilla is now free of charge, and the code
is publically viewable here.

Issues may be added, but I am not following them up at this point in time. So while I may comment on them, most likely I will not.

Basically I have retired from this sort of programming due to a variety of reasons, including a serious medical issue.
It is still possible that the code of ExQuilla will be adopted by someone,
who will update it and then charge for additional updates. I believe this is in the best long-term interest of customers.

But for that reason, the code license is still "All Rights Reserved" rather than made into an open source license. That also means
that I am reluctant to accept pull requests, since that would complicate any future transfer of the code license to a third party.
